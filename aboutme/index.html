    <h2>Kalli Harris</h2>
    <p>My name is Kalli Harris. I am from Sugar City, Idaho and this is my first semester at BYU Idaho. I recently returned home from my mission in Las Vegas, Nevada and Juiz de Fora, Brazil. </p>
    <p>I love being outdoors and spending time with my friends and family. I have 10 people in my family. My mom, my 3 older brothers, my 3 sister in laws, and my 2 nieces. They are all crazy, but I love them.</p>
    <p>Before my mission, I attended Austin Kade Academy, and received a certificate to be a nail technician. I am currently working at a salon doing nails as well while I am going to school.</p>
